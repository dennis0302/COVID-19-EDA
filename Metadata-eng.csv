For more information about this table please see the website: <a href=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/13260002"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">User Guide and Data Dictionary for Preliminary COVID-19 Data (opens new window)</a>.",,,
2,"Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, these data are considered preliminary. The data published by Statistics Canada only account for those where a detailed case report was provided by the provincial or territorial jurisdiction to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Statistics Canada’s detailed preliminary confirmed cases will not match the total case reporting done at the provincial and territorial levels which are reported daily by each jurisdiction and compiled by the PHAC.  The discrepancy is due to delays associated with the submission of the detailed information, its capture and coding. Hence, Statistics Canada’s file on detailed case reporting is a subset of the total counts reported by the health authorities across Canada.",,,
3,Confirmed cases are laboratory confirmed cases for which a case report form has been received by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) from provincial or territorial partners.,,,
4,"On November 26th 2020, this direct-download data file replaced the data table 13-10-0781-01 of detailed confirmed cases from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).",,,

6,"The file includes some cases for which all of the information is missing, either because no information is available for them or because information is under review. These cases have been kept on the file to reflect a more accurate count of total COVID-19 cases in Canada even though there is no information available on those cases at this point.",,,
